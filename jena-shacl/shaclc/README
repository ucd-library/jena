== SHACLC parser

The SHACLC parser tarnslates shaclc synatx into an RDF graph (rather than
creating the shapes tree directly).

To make the SHACLC parser:

Run the script 

   shaclc-parser

which runs javacc to create the parser in 
../src/main/java/org/apache/jena/shacl/compact/parser

and cleans up the output files to remove or surpress Java warnings.
